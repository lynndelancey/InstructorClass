# InstructorClass

This Java program is part of my CSC400 Portfolio Project. It demonstrates object-oriented programming, custom queue implementation, and sorting algorithms using quick sort.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The application allows users to:
- Create an `Instructor` class with first name, last name, and number of courses taught.
- Add five instructors to a custom queue.
- Display the queue contents.
- Sort the queue in two ways using quick sort:
  - Descending order by **last name**
  - Descending order by **number of courses teaching**

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Custom Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
- Quick Sort Algorithm
- Comparator-based sorting
- Queue behavior and manipulation

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lynndelancey/InstructorClass.git
